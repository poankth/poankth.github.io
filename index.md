## About Me
I am an assistant professor affiliated with the Institute of Statistics and Data Science at National Tsing-Hua University. Before joining this institution, I was a PhD student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, where I worked under the guidance of Prof. Alexandre Proutiere. In June 2023, I embarked on an enriching internship journey with CyberAgent in Japan. Prior to my academic pursuits at KTH, I gained valuable research experience as an assistant in Chi-Jen Lu's lab at Academia Sinica.
